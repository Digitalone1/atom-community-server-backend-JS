 * here rather than in multiple locations throughout the codebase.
 * Returns `ok: true` where content is the repo data from the service provider on
 * success, returns `ok: false` if they do not have access to said repo, with
 * specificity available within the `short` key.
 * @param {object} userObj - The Full User Object, as returned by the backend,
 * and appended to with authorization data.
 * @param {object} packObj - The full Package objects data from the backend.
 * @param {object} [opts] - An optional configuration object, that allows the
 * definition of non-standard options to change the fucntionality of this function.
 * `opts` can accept the following parameters:
 *  - dev_override: {boolean} - Wether to enable or disable the dev_override. Disabled
 *    by default, this dangerous boolean is inteded to be used during tests that
 *    overrides the default safe static returns, and lets the function run as intended
 *    in development mode.
 * @returns {object} - A Server Status object containing either minor repo data on
 * success or a failure.
